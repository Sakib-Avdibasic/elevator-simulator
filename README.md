# elevator-simulator

Console application written in C as part of university assignment. 

Users of the app can request the use of a desired elevator and choose a desired floor as its destination. An animation of the elevator's movement is shown when this happens.

Each elevator has a limited number of uses and must be repaired before being used again.

The admin users can add new elevators, check their usage status and schedule them for repair. They can also add new users.
